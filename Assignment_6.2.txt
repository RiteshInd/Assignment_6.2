The Pearson's chi-squared test of independence is one of the most basic and common hypothesis tests in the statistical analysis of categorical data. It is a significance test. Given two categorical random variables, X and Y, the chi-squared test of independence determines whether or not there exists a statistical dependence between them. Formally, it is a hypothesis test. The chi-squared test assumes a null hypothesis and an alternate hypothesis. The general practice is, if the p-value that comes out in the result is less than a pre-determined significance level, which is 0.05 usually, then we reject the null hypothesis.

H0: The two variables are independent

H1: The two variables are dependent

The null hypothesis of the chi-squared test is that the two variables are independent and the alternate hypothesis is that they are related.

To establish that two categorical variables (or predictors) are dependent, the chi-squared statistic must have a certain cutoff. This cutoff increases as the number of classes within the variable (or predictor) increases.



a. Is there any association between Job and default?
	

bank_full <- read.csv("D:/R/bank-full.csv", header= TRUE, sep = ";")
str(bank_full)

with(bank_full, chisq.test(job, default)) OR chisq.test(bank_full$job, bank_full$default)

# Result

Pearson's Chi-squared test

data:  bank_full$job and bank_full$default
X-squared = 60.343, df = 11, p-value = 8.008e-09

#since the p-value is < 2.2e-16 is less than the cut-off value of 0.05, we can reject the null hypothesis in favor of alternative hypothesis and conclude, that the variables, (job & default- p-value = 8.008e-09) are dependent to each other.


#R code for loading bank-additional-full dataset


bank_additional_full <- read.csv("D:/R/bank-additional-full.csv", header= TRUE, sep = ";")
str(bank_additional_full)
library("MASS")



b. Is there any significant difference in duration of last call between people having housing loan or not?

with(bank_additional_full, chisq.test(duration,housing))

# Result

Pearson's Chi-squared test

data:  duration and housing
X-squared = 3162.3, df = 3086, p-value = 0.1657


# p-value = 0.1657 is > 0.05 is greater than the cut-off value of 0.05 hence duration & housing are independent to each other.




c. Is there any association between consumer price index and consumer?

with(bank_additional_full, chisq.test(cons.price.idx,cons.conf.idx))

# Result

Pearson's Chi-squared test

data:  cons.price.idx and cons.conf.idx
X-squared = 1029700, df = 625, p-value < 2.2e-16


#p-value < 2.2e-16 and it is very much less than 0.05.we can reject the null hypothesis in favor of alternative hypothesis and conclude, that the variables, (job & Marital-p-value < 2.2e-16),(con.price.idx, consumer are dependent to each other.



d. Is the employment variation rate consistent across job types?

with(bank_additional_full, chisq.test(job,emp.var.rate))

# Result

Pearson's Chi-squared test

data:  job and emp.var.rate
X-squared = 4676.8, df = 99, p-value < 2.2e-16


#p-value < 2.2e-16 is very much less than 0.05 so they are dependent to each other.




e. Is the employment variation rate same across education?

with(bank_additional_full, chisq.test( education,emp.var.rate))


# Result

Pearson's Chi-squared test

data:  education and emp.var.rate
X-squared = 1451.6, df = 63, p-value < 2.2e-16


#p-value < 2.2e-16 is very much less than 0.05 so employment variation rate is not same across education.




f. Which group is more confident?

#Correlation Analysis What we saw in the box plot can be emphasized by correlation plot, It can tell if predictor is a good predictor or not a good predictor. This analysis can help us decide if we can drop some columns/predictors depending upon its correlation with the outcome variable.

"duration" has positive effect on people saying "yes". This is because the longer the conversations on the phone, the  higher  interest  the  customer  will  show  to  the  term  deposit.  "nr.employed",  which  is the number of employees in the bank, has positive effect for turning people to subscribe the term deposit. This can be due to the fact that the more employees the bank have, the more  influential  and  prestigious  this  bank  is.  "euribor3m"  is  another  important  variable, which denotes the euribor 3 month rate. This indicator is based on the average interbank interest rates in Eurozone. It also has positive effect since the higher the interest rate the more willingly customer will spend their money on financial tools.
